This repo aims to explore a few YOLO versions.

It also contains Yolo 8 Nano trained with cow images selected and labeled manually. The accuracy of the trained Yolov8n may not be as high as the pretrained ones but it does identify overlapping cows better than pretrained Yolov8n.

Use Yolo 11 Extra or 8 Extra for best results.
